## install R and necessary packages for analysis
## -------------------------------------------------- #

open the .R file using any text or source code editor such as:
	TextEdit, emacs, Aquamacs, notepad++ , or Xpad

set the working directory to the folder containing the data files 

the set working directory command in R is setwd()
	type ?setwd for help documentation 

to set the path type into R: 

setwd("PATH_NAME")

where PATH_NAME is the path to the mail folder

install packages if necessary:
	packages <- c("foreign","rstan", "coda", "loo", "ggplot2", "gplots")
	install.packages(packages)

You should place the folders that contain this file and the additional folders it contains into the R working directory. 

The R working directory is available via the getwd() function in R.

The attached code makes use of the file structure. As long as the folders are in the R working directory the script will find these files and work properly. 

The last version of R and Mac OS-X are:

	R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) -- "Joy in Playing"
	Copyright (C) 2018 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
	Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit)

The rstan library will only install after the successful installation of STAN, which can be downloaded here: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started

## Computer recommendations
## -------------------------------------------------- #

All models were estimated on an HPC. 

The UDS and Martin and Quinn models take approximately 12 hours per chain. If you want to run it on a laptop you will likely want to do 2 cores, and 2 chains, and let each model run over night. 

The simulated data sets take anywhere from 6 to 24 hours per chain. It is not feasible to run all simulations except on an HPC. We provide more detail below.

## Simulation Analyses
--

FOLDER: MAIN_Simulations

The simulation analysis was designed to be run on a high performance computing network where multiple jobs can be called at once. The main simulation script "Sim_Main.R" is to be called with an input argument (e.g. "R --vanilla <Sim_Main.R --args 1") this will then generate some data of a particular structure, save that data, and estimate one of the four main models tested. It assumes that the following folders exist: /true, /model_ests, and /results. 

The script was initially run using gnu parallel with the following command: seq 1 900 | time -p parallel -Jstat-cluster 'R --vanilla < Sim_Main.R --args {} > {}.out 2>&1' 

There are few quirks. The script starts by generating a list of all the models it needs to estimate. Each simulated dataset has an ID. It then checks to see if a certain dataset has been generated. If it hasnâ€™t, it then generates the dataset. If it has, it loads the dataset (the data generating process is controlled by Sim_Util_Script.R). The script also permutes the order it goes though the simulated data and models.

The simulation process will take a long time if you want to simulate the number of datasets presented in the article. As such we have also included a dataset with the simulated output: Sim_Output.csv. 

## Data and Helper Scripts
Sim_util_scrits.R - Contains some of the scripts used in Sim_Main.R 
Sim_Output.csv - Congains the outputs from the simulations run previously. 

## Stan Scripts 
Sim_Dynamic.stan - Dynamic model 
Sim_Robust.stan - Robust model
Sim_Non_Dynamic.stan - Static model (also called non-dynamic)
Sim_Mixed.stan - Mixed model

## Scripts (Sim_Main.R would have to be run 1800 times to generate all necessary simulations, Sim_Plotting.R can be run using data from Sim_Output.csv)
Sim_Main.R - Generates simulated data, and then estimates a model for them. See above for more information.
Sim_Plotting.R - Uses simulate data to generate plots in main text and appendix (Figures 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11)
Sim_Demo.R - Generates simulated data, estimates all 4 models, and then plots the true latent value along with estimated latent values (Figure 1 A:F)


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
## Appendix Scripts
--

AP_MQ_Robustness - Contain variants of the models in MQ_Dynamic.R and MQ_Robust.R that modify the modeling strategies applied to the innovation variance. Files ending with _15 estimate the inflated variance, and files ending with _Free estimate with an estimated variance parameter.
AP_Sim_Robust_Extensions - contains files that can be used to estimate a Robust model where the Degrees of Freedom are estimated instead of sigma, and where both are estimated. (Figures 12 and 13). Assumes that main simulations have all been run (pulls the generated data from that file). 
AP_Fixing_Sigma - Has files used in Appendix D to look at the impact of fixing the innovation variance (Figures 14 and 15)
AP_K_Fold_CV - Has files to estimate K-fold CV used in Appendix H
