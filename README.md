Thie repository contains the code and data for the paper "Improving Scientific Collaboration and Reproducibility through Containerization" presented at the Annual Meeting for Political Methdology, Stanford University, July 11-13. 

There are three substantive files in this repository:

1) Producing a collaborative development environment with Docker. This application is a simple rstudio gui, with a shared volume for data and code. This is a very basic example of a collaborative development environment.
2) Producing a reproducible research environment with Docker. This application builds an Rstudio gui, pulls and loads another. This is a very basic example of a reproducible research environment.
3) Data visualization and analysis. This application is a simple shiny app that allows for the visualization of the data used in the paper.

Each folder contains a README.md file that further describes the environmnet.
